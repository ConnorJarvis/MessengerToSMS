# MessengerToSMS

This will relay messages from a Facebook Messenger group chat to SMS and vice versa. 

Born out of a need to be able to have a group conversation with one party having no access to the Internet but with the ability to receive text messages.

Theoretically all you need to do to get started as far as I know:
- `Fill out config.example.js and save as config.js`
- `npm install`
- `node index.js`
